I'm the common thing to all the things I'm working on.
1st rule of programming: it's my fault.

I'll embrace the suck, I'll try even if I'll suck, that's how I'll learn.
Failure is an option, I don't fail means I don't do anything.
Version 1 sucks, but I'll ship it anyway.
It's how rapidly I can pivot, how rapidly how I can iterate.
My goal is to suck less every year

I should do it in public.
Public things are beneficial for everybody, and for me.
Doing things in public make me try to be better than I'm used to be.

I should pick stuff that matters.
Nobody really cares about me.
Stuff that matters are stuff that make ppl get things done.

People forget my failures, and remember my successes.
I should find my audience.

What cool thing did I do for someone else today?
