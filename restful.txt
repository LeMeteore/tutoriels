REST: REpresentational State Tranfer
------------------------------------

set of design principles for making
network communication more scalable/flexible


CONSTRAINTS:
------------

1 client server model:
  -  a restful service operate on client-server model
    - server: has resources of interest
    - client: want to interact with the resource stored on server
  - requires one-to-one communication

2 a restful service is stateless:
  - clients, servers, does not keep track of each other's state.
  - server do not keep track of past requests

3 uniform interface:
  - identification of resources: each resource is uniquely identified by a stable identifier (uri)
  - manipulation of resources: client sends json representation of a resource to manipulate that resource
  - self descriptive messages: http protocol?

4 hypermedia:
  - data sent to the client contains informations about what can be done next

5 caching:
  - server responses should be labelled as cacheable or non-cacheable

6 layered system:
  - there can be more than just servers and clients: proxies, gateways.
    but every component is constrained to see only the very next component.
