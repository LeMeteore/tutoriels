- Install node version manager first
------------------------------------

# apt install build-essential libssl-dev
# su patrick
# curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.30.2/install.sh | bash

# to install a specifi version of nodejs
# nvm install v5.5.0

# create a frontend project
# mkdir rtsupport
# cd rtsupport

# to create the package.json file: dependencies list
# npm init

# directory struture:
- rtsupport/
  - app.css
  - index.html
  - index.js: entry point for the app
  - alerter.js
  - components/ directory: store most of our client side js scripts, one file per react component
    - App.js:
    - channels/
      - Channel.jsx
      - ChanneForm.jsx
      - ChannelList.jsx
      - ChannelSection.jsx
    - messages/
    - users/


# before being able to work
# npm use v5.5.0

# do not forget to install the serve command for being able to browse our website
# npm install -g serve

# then to install webpack globally
# npm install -g webpack

# then manually pack all the chaos inside one file
# reminder: index.js calls functions from alerter.js
# but we dont want to source all those script inside our index.html
# webpack index.js bundle.js

# the best way to proceed is to write a webpack config file: webpack.config.js
# emacs webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
  entry: './index.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname,
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      }
    ]
  }

}

# we should install babel for this to work
# babel is letting me use last feature of js right now
# transforming js to js
# npm install webpack babel-loader@5.3.3 --save-dev

# then, calling webpack without arguments should work
# webpack

    + 2 hidden modules

# let's install webpack-dev-server
# it will automatically relaunch webpack
# when changes are made to files or to dependency graph
# and serve everything to :8080
# it can also do live reload
# npm install -g webpack-dev-server
