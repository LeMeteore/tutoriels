Man:
----
Man pages are mainly stored in the /usr/share/man directory.
However, as long as a man page is located in the MANPATH environment variable, man will be able to pick it up.
Gentoo will generally store MANPATH variables in /etc/env.d.

Within these directories are some folders with the structure manX where X is the section number.
For example, a standard man layout might look like so:
root $ls /usr/share/man | grep man
man0p
man1
man1p
man2
man3
man3p
man4
man5
man6
man7
man8
man9
mann
root $

Man page sections are:
----------------------
     (1)     User Commands
     (2)     System Calls
     (3)     Library functions
     (4)     Devices (i.e., devices in the /dev directory)
     (5)     File formats
     (6)     Games and Amusements
     (7)     Conventions and Miscellany
     (8)     System Administration and Priveledged Commands
     (9)     Kernel Routines
     (L)     Deprecated. Local. Some programs install their man pages into this section instead of (1)
     (N)     Deprecated. TCL commands

Most common organization of a man page:
---------------------------------------
    AUTHORS: the people who created or assisted in the creation of the command.
    BUGS: lists any know defects. Sometimes they aren't failures of the tool, but rather peculiarities of implementation.
    ENVIRONMENT: Describes any variables that might be needed or specific versions of the shell that may be needed for the command to operate.
    EXAMPLES or NOTES: An illustration of how to use the command including general notes.
    REPORTING BUGS: This tells you where you should report the defects or problems you are having with the command.
    COPYRIGHT: The organization that holds the copyright to this information; usually a disclaimer that this is free software without warranty.
    SEE ALSO: Other commands or other documentations that are related to this command.

Browsing:
---------
Sometimes we may need to narrow down what man page we want.
The first way would be addressing by section.
To found out a description of a section, one can use man like this:
root $man 3 intro

There is another way to search for commands that may return multiple results
To do so, we use the -K option to the man command like so:
root $man -K sleep

Viewing:
--------
root $man 1 bc # bc cmd on section 1 of man pages
root $man 1p bc # posix version of bc of section 1 of man pages
root $man bc # everything related to bc

Missing man pages?
------------------
When you don't find man pages about foo, you can try others commands like:
root $foo --help, foo -h, foo -?
root $info fo
root $whatis foo, apropos foo
root $dpkg --listfiles foo, dpkg --search foo
root $locate '*foo*'
root $find / -name '*foo*'
