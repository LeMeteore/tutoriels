pub   4096R/29BB17B9 2014-08-21 [expire : 2024-08-18]
uid                  keybase.io/knibals <knibals@keybase.io>
sub   4096R/81371D20 2014-08-21 [expire : 2024-08-18]

----------------------------

4096 == the bit length of the key
RSA == R
DSA == D
Elgamal == g (only seen in subkeys)

Historically there was a "G" for an Elgamal key that could both encrypt and sign,
but that was dropped from OpenPGP. The current lowercase "g" Elgamal is an encrypt-only key.

----------------------------

sub   4096R/81371D20 2014-08-21 [expire : 2024-08-18]

Sub is for subkeys. They are other keys that go along with the main, or primary, key.
A common usage pattern is for the primary to be used for signing,
and the subkey used to encryption.

----------------------------

uid                  keybase.io/knibals <knibals@keybase.io>

There is a minimum of 1 uid. There is no maximum.
There are also "uat" lines, of which there are zero or more.
A uat is used to store other things aside from text (for example, photo IDs).

It is possible to have several.
